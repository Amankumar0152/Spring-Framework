#What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that makes it easy to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications.
It simplifies development by removing complex XML configurations and automatically handling many setup tasks for you.

Key Features

Auto Configuration: Automatically configures your project based on the dependencies you add.

Embedded Servers: No need for external servers — use embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.

Production Ready: Includes health checks, metrics, and monitoring out of the box.

Spring Initializr: Quickly create new projects with required dependencies.

Dependency Management: Uses “starter” dependencies to simplify your build configuration.

Why Learn Spring Boot?

It’s one of the most popular frameworks for building Java-based web applications and microservices.

Reduces development time and boilerplate code.

Perfect for both beginners and professional developers who want to build scalable backend systems.
